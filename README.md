## Run app locally

Before running your application, make sure you have Docker installed and running. Then run this command from your application's root folder:

```

## Deployment

### Self-hosting

See the [self-hosting instructions](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/self-host/build) for how to use `encore build docker` to create a Docker image and configure it.

## Testing

To run tests, configure the `test` command in your `package.json` to the test runner of your choice, and then use the command `encore test` from the CLI. The `encore test` command sets up all the necessary infrastructure in test mode before handing over to the test runner. [Learn more](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/develop/testing)
